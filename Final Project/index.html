        Is There Unspoken Demand for Abortions?
    </h1>
    <div id="background"> <br> Abortion rates have been declining sharply in the last 15 years. Many anti-choice groups attribute that 
        to the abortion laws put into place while pro-choice groups attribute this to less unintended pregnancy and better sexual education.
        The policy implications of this decline are important to understand. In this article, we will see if the demand for abortion
        is influenced by the increasingly restrictive laws put into place. If demand, especially in states with more restrictive laws, is high that would support 
        the fact that there are women wanting abortions that are unable to resoundingly advocate for them. <br> </div>

            Abortion rate has swiftly declined in the last 10 years
        </h2>
        <p> After the monumentous decision in Roe v. Wade, the abortion rate increased throughout the 70s and held steady throughout the 80s
            despite discriminatory policies like the Hyde Amendment. After the "undue burden" framework was created in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992,
            rates declined sharply the year following and then steadily up until 2008. From then on, abortion rates have continued to decrease and have
            now fallen to lowest level since Roe v. Wade.

            Now, let's try to understand the breakdown of the decline in abortion in these last 10 years by state
        </h1>
        <p> The breakdown by state helps illustrate the decrease in abortion rate we saw overall. The decrease is 
            especially poignant in the Midwest and South. Interestingly, we see a similar story both when looking 
            at abortion rate by state of occurrence and by state of residence. </p>

            26 states had restrictive or highly restrictive abortion access in 2017
        </h2>
        <p> In the last 10 years the number of restrictive abortion laws have increased exponentially. 
            States continued their assault on abortion in 2017, with 63 new restrictions put in place.
            Now, more than 50% of women of reproducive age live in a state considered to have restrictive or highly
            restrictive abortion access. Additionally, many states in this category have laws that directly 
            conflict with scientific evidence.

            Googling abortion was just as popular in states with more restrictive laws  
        </h2>
        <p> It has been said that Google is like a truth serum. So looking at the Google Trends for abortion searches
            can let us estimate how much demand there is for abortion in the state. Google Trends returns the number 
            of relative searches so values are calculated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 is the location with
             the most popularity as a fraction of total searches in that location, and a value of 50 indicates a 
             location where that search is half as popular. With this in mind, we see that more 
             restrive states are just as interested in abortion over the years. For example, in 2017 the year we looked at above,
            67% of the states with a relative search popularity of 80+ had restrictive or highly restrictive abortion access.
